# MCPOL-1.0

Monte Carlo Code for Polarizable Fluids (MCPOL) is a Monte Carlo (MC) code developed
in the Matyushov group to investigate the eect of solute and solvent polarizabilities on
properties of interest such as solvent reorganization energies and structure factors. MCPOL
is available in serial and parallel versions, where Message Passing Interface (MPI) is used for
parallelization. In the current version, only the canonical (NV T) ensemble is implemented
for hard-sphere solutes and solvents.
